# Cellular-Automata
"In-Organic Game of Life" exhibited at Pictor Gallery, Chelsea from 01/04/2023-01/27/2023. The work constitues simulation of cellular automata, similar to "Conway's game of life" but using only logical operators. I aim to bring out in-organic structures hidden in models for organic evolution.
